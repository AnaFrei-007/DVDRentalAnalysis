Business Report: A DVD rental business would like to identify who their top 10 customers are based on their total rental spending
in order to target marketing and promotional offers. By identifying these high-value customers, the business can offer loyalty rewards,
personalized recommendations, improve retention, and benchmark the effectiveness of any marketing campaigns. I will be querying the
customer, payment, and rental tables to calculate the total amount spent by each customer and rank them.

Business Question: Who are the top 10 customers based on total rental spending?
